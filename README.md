Food Waste Management Application
 
The Food Waste Management application is designed to reduce food wastage by connecting restaurants and food donors with NGOs, ensuring surplus food reaches those in need. The application provides a user-friendly interface for donors and NGOs to manage their activities, including registering, logging in, updating profiles, and managing food donations or requests.

Key features include secure user authentication for sign-up and login, profile management, and built-in validation to ensure accurate input (such as email validation). The platform streamlines the process of redistributing excess food, promoting efficiency, accountability, and social responsibility in both personal and organizational settings.
